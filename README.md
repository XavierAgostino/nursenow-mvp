## About This Project

This landing page was developed as part of an entrepreneurship course assignment focused on rapid MVP development and market validation. The project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to quickly test startup concepts and gather user feedback.

**NurseNow Concept**: A digital platform where healthcare facilities can post open nursing shifts and licensed nurses can browse and accept positions that match their schedule and expertise.

## Assignment Context

**Course**: ENG-SCI 30 - Startups: From Idea to Exit  
**Institution**: Harvard University, Faculty of Arts & Sciences  
**Assignment**: Assignment #3: MVPs, In Theory and Practice (Part 2)  
**Objective**: Design and build an MVP landing page to validate core business assumptions using AI-powered development tools

This project represents Part 2 of a comprehensive MVP analysis assignment. Part 1 involved analyzing potential MVPs for established tech companies and developing an MVP strategy for NurseNow. Part 2 required using "vibe coding" tools to rapidly prototype and deploy a functional landing page that could validate key business hypotheses about the healthcare staffing marketplace concept.

## Key Features

- **Dual-sided marketplace messaging** targeting both healthcare facilities and nurses
- **Trust and credibility indicators** including HIPAA compliance and insurance coverage
- **Social proof elements** with testimonials and partner hospital logos
- **Clear value propositions** highlighting cost savings and scheduling flexibility
- **Mobile-responsive design** optimized for healthcare professionals on-the-go
- **Conversion-focused layout** with prominent sign-up forms and calls-to-action

## Technical Implementation

**Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
**Typography**: Inter font family  
**Icons**: Custom SVG graphics  
**Hosting**: Vercel static deployment  
**Development Approach**: No-framework vanilla web technologies for rapid prototyping

## Design Principles

The visual design follows healthcare industry standards with a clean, professional aesthetic:

- **Color Palette**: Primary blue (#1e88e5) and accent teal (#26a69a) for trust and medical associations
- **Layout**: Grid-based responsive design with mobile-first approach  
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with accessible contrast ratios
- **Interactions**: Subtle animations and hover states for enhanced user experience

## MVP Validation Strategy

This landing page prototype specifically tests critical business assumptions required for Part 2 of the assignment:

### Primary Validation Questions:
1. **Market Pain Point**: Do healthcare facilities experience significant challenges with nursing shift coverage?
2. **Value Proposition Clarity**: Is the "hours not days" promise compelling enough to drive sign-ups?
3. **Two-Sided Market Appeal**: Can a single landing page effectively communicate value to both facilities and nurses?
4. **Trust and Credibility**: What compliance and verification factors are essential for healthcare marketplace adoption?
5. **Conversion Potential**: Will the dual sign-up approach (clinic vs. nurse tabs) generate meaningful user interest?

### Assignment Requirements Met:
- ✅ Company name prominently displayed
- ✅ Professional healthcare imagery and branding
- ✅ Dual sign-in/sign-up interface with role selection
- ✅ Clear calls-to-action throughout the page
- ✅ No backend infrastructure (pure frontend prototype)

## Development Approach

**AI-Powered Development**: This project utilized AI-powered "vibe coding" tools as required by the assignment, demonstrating rapid prototyping capabilities for startup MVPs. The development process involved iterative prompt engineering to achieve professional-grade results suitable for real market validation.

**Technical Excellence**: Built using modern web standards with focus on performance and accessibility. The codebase demonstrates clean HTML structure, efficient CSS organization, and progressive enhancement principles suitable for production deployment.

**Deployment**: Leveraged Vercel for instant deployment and hosting, enabling real user testing and data collection capabilities essential for MVP validation.
